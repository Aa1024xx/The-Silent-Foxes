### Interactive Visualization:

#### Q1 What is the distribution of officers' salary across race, gender and other discrepancies? [by Density] 

#### Q2 What is the distribution of the categories of the misconducts (illegal search, use of force, etc.) for officers with or without awards? [by Box plot]

#### Q3 Can we compare misconduct maps according to different time lines(monthly, yearly) and make an interactive map to show the continuous change? [by Circular Barplot]

#### Q4 Can we dig more information from the cold zone(misconducts happened lower annually/on average) by making a heat map?

#### Q5 What are the common/different patterns(focus on salary and awards) for those cold zone shares? Can we make heat maps for possible factors and compare them?
