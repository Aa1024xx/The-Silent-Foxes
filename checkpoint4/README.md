## Checkpoint 4 Graph Analytics

### Q1 Can we use machine learning models, e.g. linear regression, to find correlations between complaint reports and officers?
### Q2 What variables inside the dataset have the most significant impact on the victims? If yes, can we fit the pattern into any machine learning model?
### Q3 Can there be other possible factors contributing to the victims?
### Q4 Can outliers(in different scenarios) share some common pattern that can fit any machine learning models?
