## Checkpoint 4 Graph Analytics

### Q1 Is there a relationship between the clusters of officers with most complaints and their salary( and awards received)?

```
How to run:
1. In src/Q1, 
  open the terminal, and run the command 'python3 cp4-1.py'
You will see the network graph we have for our Question 1.

Note: Make sure you have all following modules installed:

networkx
matplotlib
psycopg2
numpy
seaborn

As mentioned in comments of code, adding more edges by using last_unit_id will take a long time to run, since there are too many nodes and we are going to check and find relationship for each of them. 
You can choose whether to test it or not just by uncommenting the related lines of code.
```
### Q2 Can we identify clusters of officers who are likely to be co-accused by factors related to their career, like working environment, salary, rank?
