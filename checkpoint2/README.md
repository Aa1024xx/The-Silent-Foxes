## Data Exploration

### Getting Started
#### To run Tableau
We've saved our charts in a Tableau workbook. As long as you have the CPDP database on your computer, it should run without an issue. Double click on the .twb (or .twbx) file to open the workbook in Tableau. You may be prompted to enter your password for the 'postgres' user. The descriptions below correspond to the tabs at the bottom left of the workbook.

### Our Questions
### Q1
Is there a correlation between the salary of the officer and the number of complaints?

-- Line charts showing the trend of annual allegation count, annual average salary over years by running:
```
Open Q1.twb with Tableau, and connect to database CPDB, 
a table called 'Allegation Annual Count' shows how total number of allegations received by officers changes over year;
a table called 'Average Annual Salary' shows the change of officers' average salary over year;
```
-- Compare the trends of these two line charts above with a liner chart and a side-by-side bar chart
```
In Q1.twb,
line chart: Annual Allegation Count & Average Salary;
Side-by-side bar chart: Compare Annual Salary & Allegation Count
```

### Q2
Is there a correlation between the number of allegations received before an officerâ€™s first settlement case and number of allegations received after?

-- A Bubble diagram and a heatmap show the number of settled allegations
```
Open Allegation Annual Settlement Count.twb with Tableau, and connect to database,
Bubble diagram: Allegation Annual Settlement Count
Heatmap:  Allegation Annual Settlement Count
```
-- A Bubble diagram and a heatmap show the number of received allegations
```
Open Allegation Annual Received Count.twb with Tableau, and connect to database,
Bubble diagram: Allegation Annual Received Count
Heatmap:  Allegation Annual Received Count
```
Compare the these two charts and draw the conclusion.
