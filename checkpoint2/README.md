### Getting Started
#### To run Tableau
We've saved our charts in a Tableau workbook. As long as you have the CPDP database on your computer, it should run without an issue. Double click on the .twb (or .twbx) file to open the workbook in Tableau. You may be prompted to enter your password for the 'cpdb' user. The descriptions below correspond to the tabs at the bottom left of the workbook.
